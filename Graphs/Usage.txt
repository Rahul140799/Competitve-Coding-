				BFS

1) If a Solution is not far from the root of the tree

2) If tree is very deep and solutions are rare ( DFS will take long time )

3) Finding the shortest path


				DFS


3) If tree is wide ( BFS needs too much memory )

4) Solutions are frequent and located deep inside the tree

5) Determining whether a path exists between two nodes
